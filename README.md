# pc_age_ad_problem

Code created to solve a problem for an ad for PC AGE IT training, often seen on the NJ Transit Path train.

Ad says: "You Either Have IT or You Don't!"

Lists a sequence of numbers: 3, 4, 6, 9, 13 and asks "What comes next?"

"15., 16., 17., or 18."

This code uses recursive and non-recursive functions to solve the problem plus more.
